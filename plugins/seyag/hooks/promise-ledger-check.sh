# Stop hook: when the agent tries to end a turn whose final message makes a
# deferred-work promise ("I'll file that later", "follow-up after this PR")
# WITHOUT a same-turn write to a ledger file, block the stop once and remind.
# The promise dies in chat otherwise, and the owner ends up asking "what's the
# plan for those?" a session later.
#
# Enforcement geometry: a deterministic scan of the ASSISTANT'S OWN output,
# blocking at most once via the native `stop_hook_active` flag. If the promise
# is already tracked, or is a process action that needs no ledger entry, the
# agent says so and stops again (the second stop is allowed).
#
# Trigger is deliberately narrow (deferred-WORK verbs + a deferral marker, or a
# line-leading queue label) to keep false positives low; the same-turn ledger
# write suppresses the common "promised AND filed in the same breath" case.
#
# What counts as a ledger write (same turn only):
#   - an Edit / Write / MultiEdit whose file_path matches the ledger regex.
#     Default: (^|/)(backlog/|tracker/|CURRENT\.md|BACKLOG\.md|TODO\.md|claude-memory/roles/)
#     `claude-memory/roles/` is there because every session on this machine
#     keeps its to-do list in ~/Documents/claude-memory/roles/<name>.md.
#     SYG_LEDGER_PATH_RE (a Python regex, matched with re.search against
#     the file_path) REPLACES the default when set and non-empty. If it is set
#     but does not compile, the default is used; the hook never crashes on it.
#   - a Bash command containing a tracker CLI filing call
#     (`tracker|backlog task create|edit`). Harmless where no such CLI exists.
#   - a Bash command that WRITES a ledger path: it names one (directly, or
#     relative to an earlier `cd` in the same command) and carries a write
#     shape (`sed -i`, `perl -i`, `>`/`>>`, `tee`, a python/node file write).
#     A read-only mention (`grep … roles/x.md`) does not credit. Unlike the
#     Tzurot original, which credits only the CLI shape: sessions here keep
#     their to-do lists in role files and often edit them through Bash.
#
# Ported from Tzurot's project hook of the same name (a same-named project hook
# overrides this one via run.sh). Generalized: the ledger path set, the env
# override, the tail-bounded read, and the banner's rule citation.
#
# Every external failure (no jq, no python3, unreadable transcript) exits 0.
# Pinned by promise-ledger-check.probe.sh.

# every position and anchor rule below is tuned to catch. In typed code,
# `remaining` / `outstanding` / `queued` are ordinary field names.
#

#
# SHARED, not queue-list-scoped: this rewrites `final_text` for every matcher
# below, PROMISE and ALT included. The motivating case was a pasted type
# declaration, but the consequence reaches further — "I'll `refactor` this
# later" no longer fires, because the verb is inside the stripped span. Accepted
# under the same cost model, and stated here so a future editor does not assume
# the prose matchers see the raw message.

# toward firing, which is the safe direction; 4-space INDENTED code blocks are
# not stripped at all; and a status heading like "## Remaining Tasks" fires,
# which is arguably correct rather than a false positive — such a heading is a
# list of deferred work.
#
# One known FALSE NEGATIVE, the expensive direction, kept deliberately: a
# trigger word wrapped in its own span ("**Still `queued`**: …") does not fire.
# Note this is NOT merely because the span is removed — a backtick SPLITS the
# phrase, so "still queued" fails to match whether the span survives or not.
# Keeping trigger-bearing spans therefore does not fix it; only deleting the
# backtick characters would, and that turns "`remaining: number` is the field"
# into a line-leading label, trading this rare miss for a likelier misfire.
# Widen this only on an observed misfire, not on speculation: every previous

# NO filename escape hatch. An earlier version passed the turn whenever the
# closing message mentioned any ledger filename, on the theory that naming the
# file meant the promise was tracked there. That inference is topic-correlated,
# not commitment-specific, and it collapses on exactly the days it matters: when
# the backlog IS the work, those filenames appear constantly for unrelated
# reasons, and every promise made that day sails through. Removed deliberately —
# a false positive costs one acknowledged turn (this hook blocks at most once),
# while a false negative costs an untracked commitment. The costs are asymmetric
# by orders of magnitude, so this fails toward firing.

# Deferred-WORK promise: a work verb + a deferral marker, reasonably close.
# Narrow on purpose — "I'll merge once CI passes" (process, not backlogged
# work) lacks a work verb here and is correctly ignored. A work verb right
# after an article is a NOUN, not a promise ("I'll commit the fix … once",
# "I'll push the update once CI passes"), excluded by the lookbehinds below.
# Measured 2026-09-25 over 3,706 turn ends: 36 fires, 24 true, 10 misfires,
# of which this noun shape was one. Six of the other nine are a queue label
# ("Remaining:", "Still open:") over in-flight PR/CI/review status; no
# lexical rule separates those labels from a real open list ("Still open:
# CI, and the GitGuardian dismissal you owe"), so they stay, ~1 ack per 600
# turn ends. Measured trade: a genuine promise whose verb is only in noun
# position ("I'll make a fix for that later") no longer fires; none of the
# 24 true fires had that shape. Widen on an observed miss, not speculation.

# That form carries no future-tense verb and no deferral marker, so it slipped
# past the prose matcher on every occurrence of a full session.
#
# POSITION is the discriminator, not proximity. A label LEADS A LINE; a prose
# mention sits mid-sentence. An earlier version only required the anchor
# punctuation within ~60 chars of the queue word, which fires on ordinary writing
# in an em-dash-heavy style: "two runs are still queued on GitHub's side — nothing
# for us to do" matched, and so did "the work here is outstanding — nice catch".
# A hook firing on normal sentences at every turn-end trains reflexive
# acknowledgement, which destroys the signal more thoroughly than missing would.

# bold/italic markup), with the anchor following inside a SHORT same-line window.

# Headings get one extra word — a bare "queue" — under a STRICTER rule than the

# unambiguously a deferred-work list, while "the BullMQ queue: jobs run in order"
# is ordinary prose in any codebase with a job queue (BullMQ, Redis, a task
# runner). Heading position is strong evidence, so it can afford a weaker word;
# the list matcher cannot.
#
# But heading position alone is not enough for a word this weak: "## Queue
# Configuration" and "## Queue Health" are headings ABOUT a job system, not
# lists of deferred work. So bare "queue" must be the WHOLE heading, while the
# multi-word phrases may appear anywhere in one ("## Remaining Tasks" is a
# deferred-work list no matter what follows the trigger).

# Lead-in punctuation. ASCII hyphen included deliberately: the owner dictates by
# voice, and transcribers render a spoken pause as a plain "-", never an em dash.
# An anchor class omitting it would miss the most likely real form while
# accepting the typographically-correct one nobody types.
#
# Dash-family anchors REQUIRE leading whitespace; colons do not. Without that,
# the window reaches the hyphen inside an ordinary compound word: "Remaining
# work is user-facing polish." matched, because the lazy scan walked 13 chars
# and found the "-" in "user-facing". Technical prose is dense with such
# compounds (fail-closed, read-only, cross-user, long-lived), so that is a
# routine sentence, not a contrived one. Colons need no whitespace guard — they
# never occur inside a word.
#
# The WINDOW is what stops a colon reaching across a clause, and 6 is measured
# rather than guessed. Tail length between the trigger word and the anchor:
#   real labels  → 0, 0, 0, 2, 6   ("Remaining:", "**Still queued**:", "Remaining Tasks:")
#   ordinary prose → 8, 9, 9       ("Remaining question:", "Outstanding balance:")
# A window of 6 keeps every label form actually written and rejects all three
# prose forms. It gives up one uncommon true positive — "Still queued behind

PROMISE LEDGER — deferred-work promise without a same-turn ledger write
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Your closing message defers work, but nothing was written this turn to
a ledger: a backlog/TODO file, a tracker, or this session's role file.
It matched one of:
  - a prose promise      — "I'll add that later" / "as a follow-up"
  - an enumerated queue  — "**Still queued**: a, b, c" / "## Remaining"
The second form is the one that reads as innocuous: a list under a
label carries no future-tense verb and no deferral marker, which is
exactly why it goes unnoticed long enough to lose real commitments.
A promise that lives only in chat dies at the next compaction.

Do ONE of:
  - File it now (the project's backlog/TODO file or tracker, or this
    session's role file), then stop; or
  - If it's already tracked or is a process action that needs no
    ledger entry, say where/why in one line and stop again (this
    gate fires only once per turn — the next stop proceeds).
