"""Shell quote stripping, shared by every hook that has to scan a command line.

HARNESS PLUGIN COPY: vendored from the Tzurot repo's .claude/hooks/lib. In this
plugin its consumers are the hooks listed under CONSUMERS below, each pinned by
its .probe.sh; this module is also pinned directly by tests/shell_quotes.probe.sh
(all run via tests/run-probes.sh). The CONSUMERS list below names this
plugin's consumers first, then Tzurot's; mentions of Tzurot hooks and of the
TS test are kept for provenance and say so.

WHY THIS IS A MODULE AND NOT THREE COPIES
-----------------------------------------
Three hooks need the same thing: replace each quoted span in a command string
with a placeholder, so that argument CONTENT (a commit message, a `-m` body, an
example command quoted in prose) cannot influence a structural scan of the
command. In Tzurot, where this module began, each of them had its own copy, and
the copies had already diverged — lossy-pipe-guard's was fixed while
develop-code-commit-guard's and cwd-drift-guard's kept the bug for another PR.

The bug is worth stating precisely, because the naive version looks obviously
correct and is not. Stripping single-quoted spans and double-quoted spans as two
INDEPENDENT passes pairs raw quote characters with no notion of which quote type
is already open, so an ordinary apostrophe inside a double-quoted argument is
read as a real delimiter and pairs with a later one:

    git commit -m "it's" | grep "isn't"     MEASURED: the guard exited 0
    echo "it's" && git commit -m "won't"    MEASURED: strips to `echo S`

In the first, the apostrophes in `it's` and `isn't` pair, erasing the pipe and
`grep` between them. In the second, they erase the entire `git commit`. Both are
ordinary English in a commit message, not adversarial input.

Swapping the pass order only mirrors the bug — a literal `"` inside a
single-quoted argument then pairs the same naive way — so the two-pass strategy
has no correct ordering. It needs STATE, which is what this scanner has.

FAILURE DIRECTION
-----------------
An UNTERMINATED quote strips NOTHING (returns None). Dropping to end-of-text
would delete a real invocation and produce a bypass; keeping the text merely
over-arms the caller, and over-arming is the recoverable direction for all three
consumers.

WHAT strip_quoted DOES NOT SEE
------------------------------
A quoted span is replaced WHOLE, which means a command substitution nested
inside one is erased along with it — while bash still executes the inner
command. Measured, all three forms ran the inner commit:

    echo "$(git commit -m x)"   ->  echo S   (the invocation is gone)
    echo "`git commit -m x`"    ->  echo S
    echo $(git commit -m x)     ->  intact   (unquoted survives the strip)

The even quote count means the scan closes cleanly and the caller never
reaches the unterminated-quote safe direction above. `substitution_spans`
exists for that: it reads the substitution CONTENTS straight out of the raw
text so a caller can scan them as commands in their own right, which is what
bash treats them as. `strip_heredoc_bodies` is its companion — without it a
span holding the repo's canonical `$(cat <<'EOF' … EOF)` commit message would
be scanned including the message body.

CONSUMERS
---------
In this plugin (hooks/):
    lossy-pipe-guard.sh           strip_quoted, strip_heredoc_bodies,
                                  substitution_spans_matching, HEREDOC_OPENER
    cwd-drift-guard.sh            strip_quoted_indexed, strip_heredoc_bodies,
                                  QUOTED_SPAN, ESCAPED_BLANK (substitution-blind,
                                  the lower-stakes drift-warning case)
    grep-escaped-dollar-guard.sh  strip_heredoc_bodies
    pr-monitor-reminder.sh        _words, strip_heredoc_bodies
    broad-walk-guard.sh           command_pipelines (the shared command splitter),
                                  unwrap_runners, strip_redirections
    lib/delete_commands.py        command_pipelines, unwrap_runners,
    (for cache-rm-redirect.sh     strip_redirections
     and recursive-rm-guard.sh)
Tzurot's own copy of this module also serves its develop-code-commit-guard and
board-commit-branch-gate (the latter uses strip_quoted_indexed plus
wrapped_command_strings, deliberately not executed_segments, because it
resolves add pathspecs back to real paths). The public functions here are
pinned directly by tests/shell_quotes.probe.sh.

A THIRD THING strip_quoted DOES NOT SEE, distinct from the substitution case
above: a WRAPPER's string argument. `bash -c "…"`, `sh -c "…"` and `eval "…"`
hand their argument to a shell as a command, so the strip that correctly makes
`echo "…"` inert erases a real invocation. There are two answers, depending on
what the caller needs: `executed_segments` for a caller that just wants
scan-ready segments, `wrapped_command_strings` for a caller that needs the
raw inner string to scan its own way. Both are separate functions rather than
a change to strip_quoted because the distinction is not about quoting at all
— it is about which COMMANDS execute their arguments.

In this plugin, behaviour is pinned by tests/shell_quotes.probe.sh (cases in
tests/shell_quotes_cases.py, ported from Tzurot's
packages/tooling/src/dev/shellQuotes.test.ts), plus each consumer's own
.probe.sh. Mentions of shellQuotes.test.ts below name that Tzurot suite, the
source of the ported cases.

A hook that cannot import this module fails OPEN (its python exits non-zero and
the hook allows the command). That direction is deliberate — a PreToolUse hook
that blocked every Bash call on an infrastructure error would be unusable — but
it does mean a missing lib silently disarms a blocking guard at runtime. The
backstop is CI, not runtime: every consumer's probe exercises a case that only
passes when the import works, and `guard:hook-probes` runs them in the lint job
and in `pnpm quality`.

def _scan_events(text, bash_words=False):
    """Walk `text` once with bash's quote state machine, yielding one event per
    unit of syntax. Every quote-aware reader in this module is built on this, so
    the state machine the module docstring argues for exists exactly once.

    Events, as `(kind, payload)`:

        ("char", c)          an ordinary character outside quotes
        ("escape", c)        a backslash-escaped character outside quotes;
                             payload is the character bash would produce
        ("continuation", "") a backslash-newline outside quotes, which bash
                             deletes entirely rather than making literal
        ("quoted", value)    a COMPLETE quoted span, emitted at the closing
                             quote; payload is the span's VALUE — delimiters
                             removed and escapes resolved as bash resolves them
                             for that quote type
        ("unterminated", "") the text ended with a quote still open; always the
                             last event when it appears

    A quoted span's inner characters produce no events of their own — a reader
    that wants them reads the `quoted` payload. `strip_quoted` discards that
    payload (a span is a placeholder to it); the readers that run a span's
    contents as a command need the value, which is why it is resolved here
    rather than left raw.

    Inside SINGLE quotes nothing escapes and the value is verbatim. Inside
    DOUBLE quotes a backslash is literal EXCEPT before `$`, a backtick, `"` or
    `\\` (where it is removed and the character kept, so `"a\\"b"` stays one
    span) and before a newline (where both are removed). That is bash's rule,
    argued from its documented quoting behaviour rather than a runtime repro.

    `bash_words=True` (the `_tokens` reader only; `strip_quoted` and its
    siblings keep the plain behaviour their consumers are pinned on) adds two
    things bash does outside quotes:
    - a `#` that STARTS a word begins a comment to the end of the line, so an
      apostrophe in it opens no quote (`# it's fine` NEWLINE `rm -rf x` hid
      the rm from every splitter consumer). `a#b` and `$#` are not comments.
    - `$'…'` (ANSI-C quoting) yields its decoded value, and `$"…"` is a double-
      quoted string, so `rm $'-rf' x` reads as `rm -rf x`, not `rm $-rf x`.

      executed;
    - an unquoted `#`: a comment makes its apostrophes and double quotes
      literal, and whether a `#` starts one is not modelled;
    - a `$'…'` region whose content ends in a backslash: ANSI-C quoting escapes
      that quote, so the region really ends later (the escape itself is not
      modelled — every other region closes at its first `'`, which is also
      right for `$'…'` without a trailing backslash);
    - any extracted span that may have ended at the wrong character: its own
      quotes are unbalanced, a quoted region in it holds a paren, or it carries
      a `#` or a `case` word (the structural paren count below then resumes the
      outer scan with the wrong quote state).

    Within the skip, two more rules keep it from over-skipping: an apostrophe
    inside double quotes is literal (double-quote state is tracked for exactly
    that), and an UNTERMINATED single quote skips nothing — the apostrophe is
    read as literal, where skipping to end of text would hide every later span.
    Each fallback trigger is pinned by its own case in shellQuotes.test.ts and
    each observed bypass shape by a probe row in the two blocking guards.

    KNOWN UNDER-ARM, same file, pinned by "a quoted `)` inside a span ends it
    early": `)` is counted structurally, so `$(echo ")" && git commit)` yields
    only `echo "` and anything after that paren escapes the scan. Modelling
    quotes inside the span would mean a second scanner with its own failure
    directions; the threat model here is habitual command shapes, matching the
    boundary the consuming hooks already state.

    Nesting is handled by PAREN DEPTH and nothing else: `$(a $(b))` yields the
    single span `a $(b)`, inner text verbatim. The callers run a regex over the
    content, and a regex sees the inner text just as well inside the outer —
    so recursing would only produce duplicate hits.

    An UNTERMINATED span runs to end of text. Unlike strip_quoted's
    strip-nothing rule, that direction is safe here: this function only ADDS
    text for the caller to scan, so an over-long span can over-arm and can
    never hide an invocation.

# `(?<!<)` keeps a here-string (`<<<word`) from reading as a heredoc opener:

#
# The marker is `\w+`, deliberately WIDER than pr-merge-review-check.sh's own

#
# PUBLIC, unlike the other module-private names: lossy-pipe-guard.sh has to
# REJOIN an emptied heredoc onto its opener line, and the opener half of that
# substitution is this same pattern. Spelling it out a second time in the hook
# is exactly the divergence this module exists to prevent — the copy there was
# written without the here-string lookbehind above and false-blocked a
# here-string followed by a piped command, so the hook composes from this name
# instead. Two consequences for anyone editing the pattern: the group NUMBERING
# (1 = the `-` indent flag, 2 = the quote character, 3 = the marker) is part of
# the exported contract, because that hook's replacement template reconstructs
# an opener from those groups; and both consumers are pinned by the heredoc and
# here-string cases in lossy-pipe-guard.probe.sh, which is where a group
# renumbering would surface.

def strip_heredoc_bodies(text):
    """Return `text` with every heredoc BODY removed, terminator line included.

    A QUOTED-delimiter heredoc body (`<<'EOF'` / `<<"EOF"`) is DATA — bash
    executes no word in it however command-shaped it looks. The companion to
    `substitution_spans`: the repo's canonical commit form is
    `git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF' … EOF)"`, so a caller scanning that span would
    otherwise scan the commit MESSAGE, and a message discussing git commit
    habits would arm a blocking guard. Pinned by the strip_heredoc_bodies cases
    in tests/shell_quotes_cases.py and by "a heredoc BODY inside a span is not
    a target" in hooks/lossy-pipe-guard.probe.sh.

    An UNQUOTED delimiter (`<<EOF`) is the one exception to "body is data": bash
    performs command/parameter substitution inside it exactly as in a
    double-quoted string, so a genuinely-executing `$(git …)` there is stripped
    as if inert — an accepted UNDER-arm. It matches what the guards' own
    top-level heredoc collapse already does, needs deliberate nested
    construction to reach, and sits inside the habitual-shapes threat model the
    consumers state; not verified against a runtime repro, argued from bash's
    documented expansion rules.

    Handles `<<MARKER`, `<<'MARKER'`, `<<"MARKER"` and the `<<-` indent form.
    The terminator must be the whole line; leading whitespace is tolerated only
    for `<<-`, matching bash.

    KNOWN LIMITATION, matching the sibling `strip_heredocs` in
    pr-merge-review-check.sh: only the FIRST opener on a line is recognized.
    Bash allows two on one line (`cmd <<A <<B` reads body A then body B), but
    search resumes past A's terminator, so B's body is left un-stripped. Fails
    SAFE — an un-stripped body only ADDS text a guard scans, which can only
    over-block, never hide a target. Pinned by "second heredoc opener on a line
    leaves its body" in shellQuotes.test.ts.

    An UNTERMINATED heredoc KEEPS the text after the opener rather than dropping
    it — the same over-arm direction as the sibling `strip_heredocs` in
    pr-merge-review-check.sh, and for the same reason. `substitution_spans_matching`
    hands this the WHOLE raw command, not one span's content, and the opener
    regex is quote-blind: a `<<WORD`-shaped string sitting inside an earlier
    quoted argument with no matching terminator line anywhere later would, under
    a drop-to-end rule, silently truncate a REAL `$(git commit …)` span that
    comes after it — a measured bypass of both blocking guards. Keeping the tail
    can only ADD text a guard scans (over-block, recoverable); dropping it can
    hide a target (a bypass, the one direction this must never take). Pinned by
    "a target after an unterminated heredoc opener still matches" in
    shellQuotes.test.ts and by the equivalent probe cases.

    A wrapper is recognized only at COMMAND POSITION — the start of `text` or
    just after a separator — so `echo bash -c "…"` yields nothing: that `bash`
    is an argument being printed, not a shell being run. A leading path is
    tolerated (`/bin/sh -c "…"`), because it is the same program.

    `eval` concatenates its arguments with spaces and executes the result, and
    so does this: `eval rm -rf x` yields `rm -rf x`. `trap` runs its first
    argument later (`trap 'rm -rf "$tmp"' EXIT` yields `rm -rf "$tmp"`), except
    in its `-p`/`-l` listing forms. `watch` without `-x`/`--exec` joins its
    arguments into an `sh -c` string, so `watch -n 5 'rm -rf x'` yields `rm -rf x`.

    Runner prefixes (`sudo`, `timeout 60`, `env -i`, `nice -n 5`, …;
    `unwrap_runners`) are skipped first, so `sudo bash -c "…"` is a wrapper.
    A shell reading its script from stdin also counts: its here-string
    (`bash <<< "…"`) and, over-arming on purpose, the arguments of an `echo` or
    `printf` piped straight into it (`echo "…" | bash`).

    PUBLIC because a second caller needs it directly: Tzurot's board-commit-branch-gate.sh
    wants the RAW, unquoted inner string rather than `executed_segments`' already
    quote-stripped segments — it builds its own resolvable `strip_quoted_indexed`
    view per level so a quoted pathspec inside a wrapper still resolves back to
    a real path, which a pre-stripped segment cannot supply.

    A leading env-assignment word (`VAR=value`, one or more) is skipped rather
    than treated as the command: bash still runs the WORD AFTER it at command
    position, so `FOO=1 bash -c "…"` is still a wrapper invocation.

    wrapper invocation (`bash -c`, `sh -c`, `zsh -c`, `eval`), itself stripped
    the same way, recursively.

    WHY A SCAN NEEDS MORE THAN strip_quoted
    ---------------------------------------
    Stripping quoted spans is what makes `echo "pnpm tracker task create x"`
    inert: the argument is data the command prints, and letting its CONTENT
    decide a structural question is the bug this whole module exists for. But
    the same strip erases `bash -c "pnpm tracker task create x"`, where the
    identical characters are a command bash runs. The strip cannot tell those
    apart on its own — only knowing which commands EXECUTE a string argument
    can, which is what `wrapped_command_strings` supplies.

    A caller scans every returned segment, so a target anywhere in the chain is
    seen. `echo` is not a wrapper, so its argument stays a placeholder and the
    inert case above stays inert.

    WHAT THIS DOES NOT SEE
    ----------------------
    A wrapper whose argument is built rather than written — `bash -c "$CMD"`,
    `eval "$(…)"` — yields the placeholder or the substitution text, not the
    command that eventually runs. Nothing textual can resolve that; the
    consumers' threat model is habitual command shapes, and `substitution_spans`
    covers the substitution half for the callers that want it.

    Recursion stops at `MAX_WRAPPER_DEPTH`; see that constant.

    Pinned by the wrapper cases in packages/tooling/src/dev/shellQuotes.test.ts

    THE command splitter for the harness's argv-reading guards

    whitespace: `cd /tmp` NEWLINE `rm -rf x/__pycache__` glued the second line
    onto `cd`'s argv and passed the guard (measured, both hooks).

    Boundaries, as bash draws them:
    - an unquoted newline, `;`, `&`, `|`, `&&`, `||`, `|&`, `(`, `)` end a
      command; a newline inside quotes does not, and neither does the `&` of a
      redirection (`2>&1`, `&>file`);
    - a backslash-newline continues the same command (bash deletes the pair);
    - leading reserved words (`if`, `then`, `do`, `{`, `!`, `time`, …) are
      dropped, so argv[0] is the program;
    - heredoc BODIES are data and are not split into commands
      (`strip_heredoc_bodies`), EXCEPT when a command in the text is a shell
      reading its script from stdin (`cat <<'EOF' | bash`, `bash <<'EOF'`,
      `sh -s <<EOF`): then bash runs the body, so the bodies are split too.
      That covers every heredoc in the text, not only the one fed to the
