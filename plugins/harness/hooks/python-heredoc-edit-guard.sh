# PreToolUse hook (matcher: Bash) — blocks an inline interpreter script (a
# `python3 -c`/heredoc invocation, or `node -e`/`--eval`) that EDITS a file,
# in favor of the Edit tool or a dispatched worker
# (the harness rules, rules/core.md).
#
# A fresh rewrite-script pays its whole body as output tokens on every edit
# and bypasses edit tracking, unlike the Edit tool's diff-only cost. Plain
# shell redirects (`echo > file`) are explicitly NOT this hook's business —
# only an interpreter invocation whose own body edits a file blocks.
#
# Three checks must ALL match for a block:
#   1. an interpreter-script invocation shape (python -c/-, a heredoc into
#      python, or node -e/--eval)
#   2. a file-write call shape inside the command text (open(...,'w'/'a'),
#      write_text/write_bytes, writeFileSync/appendFileSync)
#   3. some write target is also READ in the script, compared as the
#      whitespace-stripped target expression (`open(p)` … `open(p,'w')`,
#      `f.read_text()` … `f.write_text(`). That read-modify-write shape is
#      what an edit looks like; a script that reads inputs and writes a
#      DIFFERENT output is generation and passes. Measured on this machine's
#      transcripts (2026-09-25): of 944 commands that matched checks 1 and 2,
#      798 were read-modify-write edits and 144 wrote derived output (/tmp
#      dumps, staged copies, generated docs). An edit that reaches the same
#      file through two different expressions is a known accepted miss.
#
# Checks 1 and 2 are `grep -P` (PCRE), so the common case never spawns python;
# check 3 runs python only when both match. Fail-open on any internal error
# (grep -P or python3 unavailable, empty input, etc.) — a broken gate must not
# block real work. Checks 1 and 3 are linear-time (a 200 KB command costs
# milliseconds; before, a long space, dotted or other whitespace run stalled it).
#
# Bypass for deliberate bulk generation:
#
#   SYG_ALLOW_HEREDOC_EDIT=1 <command>
#
# The pre-0.3.20 name HARNESS_ALLOW_HEREDOC_EDIT=1 and the older legacy name
# TZUROT_ALLOW_HEREDOC_EDIT=1 are still accepted (transition).
#
# Fixture check: run hooks/python-heredoc-edit-guard.probe.sh after
# ANY edit to this hook.

PYTHON-HEREDOC EDIT GUARD — inline script rewrites a file it reads
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
A fresh rewrite-script pays its whole body as output tokens every
time (measured ~7x the Edit tool per edit) and bypasses edit
tracking. Use the Edit tool (Read the file first: Edit refuses one
this conversation hasn't Read), or dispatch the unit to a worker.

Deliberate bulk generation: prefix the command with
SYG_ALLOW_HEREDOC_EDIT=1 to pass this gate.
