# PreToolUse hook (matcher: Bash): block a bare `git` command whose pathspec
# only makes sense from the repo ROOT while the shell has drifted into a
# subdirectory. Ported from Tzurot's .claude/hooks/cwd-drift-guard.sh and
# generalized: the original hard-coded Tzurot's top-level folder names; this
# copy asks the filesystem instead, so it works in any repo with no config.
#
# The shape it catches: `git add docs/x.md` run from inside `pkg/sub` resolves
# to `pkg/sub/docs/x.md` and fails with "did not match any files", often AFTER
# the tests it was gating already passed (or, for a `git checkout -- <path>`
# revert, silently leaves the change it meant to undo).
#
# THE RULE. Every git invocation in the command is judged on its own:
#   - ROOT = `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` from the effective cwd; drift means
#     the effective cwd is strictly below ROOT (`--show-prefix` is non-empty).
#     Not a repo, or no drift → allow.
#   - The git must be bare: `git -C <path>` and `git --git-dir…` are anchored
#     and never block.
#   - For each pathspec token (a non-option word after the subcommand, and every
#     word after `--`), take its first path component C (the text before the
#     first `/`, or the whole token). BLOCK iff C does NOT exist relative to the
#     effective cwd AND C DOES exist relative to ROOT. That is exactly the
#     always-wrong shape: the path only makes sense from the root.
#
# Tokens that cannot be judged this way are SKIPPED (allowed): an absolute path;
# one starting with `~`, `-` or `:` (git pathspec magic); one containing a glob
# character `*`, `?` or `[`; one whose first component is `.` or `..`; one
# holding a `$` (unexpanded variable); one that was (partly) quoted, since the
# scan reads the quote-stripped command; a redirection target; and the value of
# `-m`/`--message` (an unquoted one-word commit message is not a path). Before
# `--` a positional word may be a ref rather than a path; it is judged anyway,
# and only blocks when a root entry of that exact name exists and the cwd has
# none.
#
# Deliberately NARROW. `pnpm`/`npm` from a subdir never block; `git status`,
# `git log` with no pathspec never block; a linked worktree's ROOT is its own
# toplevel, so it is not drift. When in doubt this hook allows: it may only
# ever ADD a block on an unambiguous mistake.
#
# EFFECTIVE CWD. A command that OPENS with `cd <dir>` runs its later steps from
# <dir>, so that target (resolved lexically) is judged instead of the payload
# cwd. A target this cannot read with certainty (a variable, substitution,
# glob, `~`, quote or backslash) allows the whole command. A `cd`/`pushd`/
# `popd` LATER in the chain stops the scan there: git steps after it run from
# a directory this hook does not track.
#
# Not ported: the original's refusal of `pnpm tracker` writes from a linked
# worktree, which is Tzurot-specific. No bypass token (the original has none).
#
# FAIL-SAFE: no cwd in the payload, no jq/python3/git, an unreadable command
# (unterminated quote) or any internal error → exit 0 (allow).
#
# Fixture check: run hooks/cwd-drift-guard.probe.sh after ANY edit to this hook.

CWD-DRIFT GUARD — command blocked
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
The shell is in a subdirectory of the repo ('$REL'), but this git
command names a path that exists only from the repo root:
$TOKENS
It will resolve against the subdir ('$REL/...') and fail with "did not
match any files", AFTER any tests in the chain already ran.

Use either:
  - git -C "\$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)" <subcommand> <paths>
    (root-anchored), or
  - run the git step in its own call from the repo root.
See rules/core.md § Lossy steps are for known output shapes: suspect
the invocation, and check you are in the checkout you mean.
