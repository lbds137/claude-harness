# tests/replay-stop-hook.sh — replay one Stop hook against the transcript
# windows local sessions would have handed it at every turn end, and report
# what it would have tripped.
#
# SECRETS WARNING: assistant text and hook stderr printed here are pulled
# verbatim from real sessions and can carry tokens, paths, or secrets. Local
# working material only — never paste into a commit, PR, or tracked doc (same
# boundary as tests/replay-hook.sh and the session-mining corpus).
#
# Usage: tests/replay-stop-hook.sh <hook-name> [--since N] [--slug SLUG] [--projects-dir DIR]
#   <hook-name>   any hook registered under Stop in hooks.json (read with jq).
#                 Any other name — unknown, or a PreToolUse hook like
#                 lossy-pipe-guard — is refused: fed Stop payloads it exits 0
#                 everywhere and reads as a false zero.
#   --since N            JSONLs modified in the last N days (default 7).
#   --slug SLUG           only ~/.claude/projects/SLUG/*.jsonl (default: all).
#   --projects-dir DIR   projects root (default $HOME/.claude/projects); lets
#                        a probe point this at a fixture.
#
# Mechanism:
#   Two modes, decided PER FILE before the turn-end pass: RECORDED if the file
#   contains any `stop_hook_summary` system entry, else INFERRED.
#
#   INFERRED (no Stop records in the file — an older session, or one with the
#   Stop hooks unconfigured): a Stop fires just before every USER-AUTHORED
#   entry (type=="user", content a string, or a list with NO tool_result
#   block — includes isMeta entries) and at EOF, PROVIDED a main-lane
#   assistant entry (isSidechain != true) occurred since the previous turn
#   end. A tool_result envelope is the harness returning a tool's own output
#   mid-turn, not a Stop.
#
#   RECORDED: the same rule, PLUS a real Stop must be attested — a
#   user-authored entry (or EOF) only ends a turn if a stop_hook_summary was
#   seen since the last main-lane assistant entry, OR the entry itself is a
#   "Stop hook feedback:" entry (string or list-text content). A
#   user-authored entry that fails this is a MID-TURN INJECTION (a Skill-tool
#   content block, a cross-session message, a pasted image, a queued prompt
#   delivered before the model resumes) — measured 2026-09-25 over the last 7
#   days: 1088 turn ends backed by a summary all ended on text, while 101
#   user-authored entries followed an assistant entry with no Stop between
#   them (58 Skill-directory injections, 8 cross-session messages, 6 pasted
#   images, 4 queued prompts) were counted as turn ends by the INFERRED rule;
#   69 of the 101 ended on a tool_use and so tripped turn-end-shape-gate. An
#   injection is skipped (not a turn end); the pending assistant entry carries
#   forward to the next candidate. Interrupts are not a contributor (3 in the
#   week).
#
#   Known RECORDED-mode undercount: turns before a file's first
#   stop_hook_summary are treated as injections (no summary has been seen
#   yet, by construction). Measured 2026-09-26: 35 candidates across 19 of 60
#   RECORDED files, mostly a single first-turn entry per file.
#
#   Either mode: system/attachment/queue-operation/progress entries never
#   start or end a turn; they ride along in whichever window they land.
#
#   Cut rule: the byte offset of the ending user-authored entry (exclusive),
#   or file size at EOF — unchanged by which entry a mode skips. A
#   stop_hook_summary between the final text and the next prompt lands INSIDE
#   the window — harmless, since the hooks ignore system entries; keeps the
#   rule simple.
#
#   Window (not the whole prefix — 200 MB x 300 turn ends would write 30 GB to
#   tmpfs): max(0, min(cut - 8_000_000, offset_of_line(cut_line - 4000))) to
#   cut — at least the last 8 MB and last 4000 lines (malformed/empty lines
#   count toward the 4000; they still occupy a line and byte offset). EXACT
#   for the three hooks as written today: TAIL_BYTES = 4_000_000 in
#   promise-ledger-check.sh / blocking-question-channel-check.sh, `tail -n
#   2000` in turn-end-shape-gate.sh — a hook reading further back needs the
#   cap raised here. One scratch file under a mktemp -d dir, trap-cleaned;
#   overwritten per turn end.
#
#   stop_hook_active mirrors the harness (set true) when the user-authored entry
#   that ended the PREVIOUS turn end here was a "Stop hook feedback:" entry
#   (the harness retries without a new user turn, and that retry's Stop
#   carries stop_hook_active: true; every hook here honours it and exits 0),
#   so mirroring it avoids double-counting a live block as a trip.
#
#   Live blocks: counted per file, independent of the replay itself and of
#   the mode — a user-authored entry (string or list-text content) starting
#   "Stop hook feedback:" whose bracketed command names THIS hook (matches
#   the run.sh bracket and a project override's bracket).
#
#   Fed to the hook DIRECTLY (`bash plugins/harness/hooks/<hook>.sh`, not
#   run.sh — a project's own `.claude/hooks/<name>.sh` override would make
#   run.sh exit 0 for everything), with `env -u CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR -u
#   SYG_LEDGER_PATH_RE -u HARNESS_LEDGER_PATH_RE` (both spellings, alias
#   window): the hook runs with ITS OWN defaults, not
#   whatever the recorded project's environment happened to set.
#
#   A trip is a non-zero exit. Output: one section per tripped turn end (last
#   main-lane assistant text before the cut, first 200 chars; slug/file:line;
#   which mode decided this turn end; the hook's stdout+stderr, first 3
#   lines), then exactly one summary line, the LAST line of output:
#     replay-stop-hook: <hook>: <tripped>/<total> turn ends tripped across <files> files (<t_inf>/<n_inf> inferred in <f_inf> files without Stop records); <live> live blocks in the logs
#   <t_inf>/<n_inf>/<f_inf> count only INFERRED-mode files; <tripped>/<total>/
#   <files> and <live> are both modes combined. Nothing else on stdout. Exit 0
#   even with trips — a report, not a gate.
#
#   Runtime observed 2026-09-26: `--since 7` against
#   blocking-question-channel-check over 87 local session-log files (2510
#   turn ends, 1316 INFERRED across 27 files) took 4m28s wall — ~107
#   ms/turn-end. turn-end-shape-gate, measured 2026-09-25/26 over a nearby
#   window: 78/2492 tripped, 78/1316 of those INFERRED — 0 of 1176
#   RECORDED-mode turn ends tripped.
#
# Exit codes: 2 on a bad hook name or bad argument; 1 if a per-file replay
# crashes (the failing file and python's exit code are named on stderr; no
# summary line prints — partial counts never print as a total); 0 otherwise
# (a report, not a gate, even when every turn end tripped).
