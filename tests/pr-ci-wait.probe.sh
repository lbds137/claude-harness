# Fixture check for plugins/harness/bin/pr-ci-wait — run after ANY edit to it.
#
# Never touches GitHub: a fake `gh` is put first on PATH. It ignores the real
# `--jq`/`--json` filters and returns fixtures already in POST-filter shape
# (same limitation Tzurot's own pr-monitor-reminder.probe.sh documents for its
# gh shim) — this probe pins pr-ci-wait's parsing of that shape, not whether
# real `gh` still produces it.
#
# HERMETIC BY CONSTRUCTION — no dependency on the checkout this probe runs
# from, or on anything in the calling shell's ambient environment:
#   - `git` runs against a disposable FIXTURE_REPO (`git init` + a commit +
#     its own `.github/workflows/claude-code-review.yml`) built fresh under
#     this probe's own mktemp dir, never this repo's real HEAD or real
#     workflow files. Every `pr-ci-wait` invocation runs with that repo as
#     its cwd.
#   - Every invocation goes through `env -i` (a CLEARED environment, not
#     `env VAR=val ... cmd`, which only ADDS to/overrides the inherited one):
#     an ambient `HARNESS_CI_ANCHOR` (this project's own `.claude/settings.json`
#     sets one, and Claude Code injects a project's settings `env` block into
#     every Bash tool call) previously leaked straight through every case that
#     didn't explicitly override it, silently switching a "no anchor
#     configured" case into anchor mode. MEASURED 2026-09-27: with
#     HARNESS_CI_ANCHOR=Probes actually exported (as it was live at the time),
#     the quiet-window case's fixture never named a "Probes" run, so
#     `anchor_complete` was never true and the gate burned the entire
#     PR_CI_WAIT_MAX_S before giving up — CI_GATE_TIMEOUT instead of
#     CI_COMPLETE. At the ~600s several cases used for that ceiling (meant as
#     "large enough never to be hit", not as a real wait), that is the
#     multi-minute hang a later run-probes.sh call reproduced from the main
#     checkout, on a DIFFERENT (post-merge) HEAD — the specific SHA on that
#     HEAD was never the mechanism; the leaked ambient env var was.
#   - No case's ceiling exceeds a few seconds (see PR_CI_WAIT_MAX_S below);
#     `run()` additionally wraps every invocation in `timeout` so a
#     regression that DOES hang fails loudly, naming the case, rather than
#     wedging the whole `run-probes.sh` gate silently.
#
# Usage: tests/pr-ci-wait.probe.sh   (from anywhere — this file and the `..`
# relative BIN path below are the only two paths that matter; copying both
# to a directory outside any git repo and running from there is exactly how
# hermeticity was verified, see the unit's report)
